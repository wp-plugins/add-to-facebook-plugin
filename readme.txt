This plugin adds a footer link to add the current post or page to a Facebook Mini-Feed.

Installation:
1) Upload the addtofacebook.php to your Wordpress plugins directory.
2) Activate the plugin from your admin interface.
3) Go to Options->Add to Facebook in your admin interface and select whether you want your link to be text, image or both.

No further setup is necessary. While the plugin is activated a link will appear after the content of your post with the text "Share on Facebook" or the Facebook icon or both. Clicking this link will bring the user to Facebook.  Once logged into Facebook your post will be added to the Mini-Feed of the account.
